# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Wave 0 of the front-end refactor: the foundation and the primitives.

### Foundation

- Package skeleton with the five family barrels, so a wave 1 agent adding a
  control never edits the top barrel.
- Geist and Geist Mono bundled as package assets, with the SIL Open Font
  License 1.1 text registered through `LicenseRegistry`. `google_fonts` is out
  of the application entirely.
- `UiColor`, `UiFields`, `UiGlass`, `UiType`, `UiShape`, `UiSpace`,
  `UiDensity`, `MotionTokens` and `UiIcons`, with `palette.dart` as the only
  file in the product carrying a colour literal.
- `UiThemeData.light()` and `.dark()`, `UiTheme`, `context.ui`, and
  `toThemeData()` for the carrier `MaterialApp`.
- Six colour roles moved from the value printed in 09 because they failed the
  composite contrast rule in 09 section 3.7. The measurements are in
  `palette.dart` beside each value.

### Primitives

- `Pressable` and `StateLayer`, which retire `InkWell`, `InkResponse`,
  `Material` and a bare `GestureDetector` at every call site.
- `Surface`, `GlassSurface` and `Scrim`.
- `FieldLayer`, the only gradient painter in the product.
- `FocusRing` and `Squircle`.
- `Popover`, `ModalRoutes` (`showUiSheet`, `showUiDialog`, `showUiModal`),
  `FieldCore`, `Announcer` and the `Density` probe.

### Controls

- A minimal `UiButton` in `primary`, `secondary` and `ghost` at size `md`,
  marked experimental. Slot C1 completes the actions family per 10 section
  4.1.

### Gallery

- `UiGallery` with the six foundation pages, mounted at `/gallery` in the
  application outside release builds, and goldened in light and dark at both
  densities.
